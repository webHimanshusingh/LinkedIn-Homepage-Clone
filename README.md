Here's a simplified LinkedIn clone implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with an about section for Mekya Lika.<br> 
This example will include basic features like user profiles, connections, and a feed. For a complete, functional application,<br>
server-side code and a database would be necessary, but this example focuses on the front-end part.<br>


This example sets up a basic HTML structure with CSS for styling and JavaScript for potential interactivity.<br>
It includes an "About" section for Mekya Lika and a simple main page for the LinkedIn clone, <br>
with sections for the user's profile, feed, and connections.<br>
